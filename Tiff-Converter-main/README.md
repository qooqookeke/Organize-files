# TiffConverter

TIFF format (tagged image file format) is a computer file format for storing raster graphics that use lossless compression, which means they’re typically used for large files that contain a lot of visual information, so they are popular among graphic artists and photographers. TIFF file size, are ideal for high-quality prints, but it can be unmanageable on the web. That’s the reason why sometimes it's better to convert Tiff images to JPG / PNG. Tiff files can be converted properly into JPG / PNG to get a good quality image at a much lower file size.

TiffConverter converts your Tiff image files online. It supports PNG and JPG. After converting the images, the files are downloaded as a ZIP folder. Then use the JPG / PNG files for uploading to a website, or as an email-attachment or on social media.

It is a tiny [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) app, built with [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).
